Scene Description: A NASCAR event, day
Announcer: Here's your host, Dale Earnhardt. All of you here for the Hell's Pass NASCAR Sprint Car Championship?
Dale Earnhardt Sr.: Uh, I certainly don't want to. But it's really just the kind of thing I want to do most every year.
Randy: This Saturday is the big big thing for us as our sponsor. We're the NASCAR champions, but unfortunately, you won't see us competing.
Announcer: [points to the TV monitor] It's NASCAR's big day on FOX Sports Network, and... [the logo changes to FOX Sports Network logo and graphics] this Saturday! [Towelie drops out of the seat in a panic, then takes a seat next to the monitor] The NASCAR Saturday is right around the corner and I'm sure you boys will be here to see your very own NASCAR race. [one by one, the boys start to race each other and make strange sounds] Oh wait, what are they doing? Why don't we join them? Oh, they're the NASCAR stars. I mean, we've never competed against anybody else. Oh, we have our own Pinewood Derby this year, and it looks like the best NASCAR races will be this Saturday? [the women run into each other and begin to bump each other] Oh yeah? Good going, girls! Let's be nice, guys! Let's be nice ladies and NASCAR folks! Yeah, that's a NASCAR thing, right?! [Stan and Kyle make a fist and hug]
Announcer: All right, here's your sponsor, Dick Dastardly!
Dastardly: Shut up, NASCAR fans!
Cartman: Hey. Can I bring a towel?
Announcer: Here's your sponsor, Chuck E. Cheese, of course. Come on, racehounds.
Announcer: There's something very exciting going on here, Chuck E. Cheese. [the camera zooms in from the left side of the booth to reveal Stan and Kyle having a very moving conversation. Moments later, he pulls out a small yellow semi, which he tosses behind him.]
Stan: What is that?
Dastardly: It's a racing semi. You know, a drag car that NASCAR kind of sport uses up.
Kyle: Yeah! I love drag cars! They're the coolest, dumbest stuff I've ever seen! NASCAR, bro!
Cartman: Hey dudes. Hey look out! [the two of them go around waving to other fans wearing safety vests; one of the women runs into the boys, who look down]
Stan: [walks around the corner, sees the semi and points to the other] Dude, what the hell does this look like? [the boys look at each other]
Announcer: They're trying to ruin a Saturday for us, you guys! [dances on down] Let's have a nice race, guys! [the two of them run across the stage. Stan and Kyle come up behind ManBearPoo]
Boys: [stuck in the middle, the semi crashes onto the road] Dude, it hit one barrier, and it went down. [the semi lands on the other, but stays on the asphalt a bit]
Announcer: [failing to make sound effects. NASCAR drivers have been hit the track] They're trying to wreck the race. [a NASCAR driver begins to collide as the boys make their way past the spectators]
Scene Description: Hell's Pass Hospital, moments later. Cartman's car rolls at the center track with a very angry Dastardly.
Chuck E. Cheese: [stops] Shut up, NASCAR fan...
Cartman: [to Stan and Kyle] I said, shut up! [they turn and head for the doors] Dude, the hell, let's try and enjoy this Saturday!
Cartman: They don't have anything better to do than race.
Kids: Yeah! [the two of them come across a NASCAR man]
Dougie: Yeah! You ain't gonna believe I got a dick in a NASCAR car no matter what!
Announcer: [two NASCAR riders are shown riding, with a NASCAR crew man behind them.] You can call it a drag car? A drag. A drag, NASCAR all the rage. [this Saturday, the drivers finish in the top five fastest-drives along the straightaway, making quite an out of the pit lane]
Scene Description: Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's recovery room.
Doctor: Well Eric, your son, he seems to be suffering from NASCAR-related brain cancer.
Cartman: [walks off to his right] But... But whoawhoa. If NASCAR really is what it is, then I wanna have NASCAR.
Doctor: Well, but he can't go home right now, so you have NASCAR.
Cartman: [takes off] Why don't you go and get some rest afterwards?
Doctor: No, because I'm gonna try and get NASCAR tomorrow! [gets another ride] Go and find my van and do some chores for as good as I can.
Cartman: [the van rolls from Cartman's wheelchair and disappears] Aahhh but I'm gonna be NASCAR tomorrow too! [looks around]
Doctor: Well, fine! You're NASCAR's best friends, Eric. [takes off] But how else can I help? You're NASCAR's best friend, and best friend no matter where you go? All right.
Cartman: Well, then I guess I've got NASCAR, all right. [a long sigh] Good! [walks away]
Scene Description: Hell's Pass, next day. A truck roll-away. Two of the ladies tumble down the aisle, and the driver comes to see Cartman.
Driver: Uhuhh, I can't go either. [Cartman looks forward and bumps onto a NASCAR]
Cartman: [stops]...so I'm not NASCAR! All right NASCAR sucks, I guess, eh. [turns around]
Scene Description: Hell's Pass, next day. Rick is driving. A girl comes to greet him.
Rick: Hey! I'm so excited!! [the driver drives up the aisle]
Dane 2: This one's getting closer! [Cartman looks down, then gets in front. Dane 2 moves to the passenger side, where Cartman is struggling to regain control] Look at him. Uh, he's so damned tired.
Cartman: Yeah! That's a miracle!!!
Scene Description: Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's recovery room. Cartman sits on the bed, coughs heavily
Doctor: Alright, so do you all feel better, son? Are you feeling better now?
Cartman: Oh, God I have NASCAR now!
Dean: Hey, that's wonderful! You! [Cartman takes off his helmet and looks at the monitor in disbelief and disbelief]
Cartman: Hey, this is awesome! [looks at Dean, then puts it back on. The monitor turns on, revealing Kenny's NASCAR page.]
Dean: Well, if you have any questions-
Cartman: [turns around, turns the page, then] Uh, how can I help you, too?? I'm NASCAR's best friends? [turns around, then the page] Here you go. How can I help you?
Cartman: I'm NASCAR's best friend, and worst friend.
Dean: Well, so long story short, can I help you?
Cartman: NASCAR's best friend. [turns around] You're NASCAR's best friend??
Cartman: But you know what? [turns around, then the page] NASCAR's best friend? Like I. [turns around and looks back]
Dean: Well, what's the most fun way to get around NASCAR?
Cartman: NASCAR's best friend? You know NASCAR's bad friend? You know what?
Cartman: You're NASCAR's best buddy and if you can't control yourself, NASCAR's worst friend [Turns around, then turns around]
Cartman: Yeah, you're NASCAR's worst friend.
Dean: Right?
Cartman: [turns around, then turns the page] NASCAR's worst friend?
Cartman: [turns around] I'm NASCAR's best friend.
Dean: Look at you! You got a NASCAR problem somewhere else!
Cartman: Oh, man! [looks at Kenny] I don't give two shits about how NASCAR is, let's see.
