Boys: Whoa-ho, whoa, yeah. We're gonna have to make it to school. [opens the door]
Liane: Okay, kids, let's take our seats? [closes the door. The class sits down next to her] Just sit here until we get to our lesson so that everyone has a seat.
Boys: [stand up] Here he comes! [a picture of the boys is shown and a girl is sitting next to her. The picture is of the girls.]
Liane: [with a cup of coffee on her head] Kids, I am so very proud to have Stan and Kyle here, because apparently, our little brother is actually a little brother to Stan.
Stan: I'm sorry, Mom. I just... wanted to... see the boy again.
Kenny: (Yeah, he's such a sweet little boy.)
Kyle: Why wouldn't Stan and Kyle take pictures of Stan and Kyle?!
Stan: Because I think you'd have missed the big picture.
Liane: [a shot of Stan and Kyle looking at each other, who are laughing as they pass by a tree. The boys look back at the boys] Okay, kids, let's just start the day off by taking a picture.
Kids: [a shot of the boys taking a picture] Hey fellas. Aaah! [they grin]
Stan: [points to the picture] Dude, it's the Best Buy.
Kyle: [points to it] What's the best place to buy stuff?
Bebe: It's just a little store and... [points to the picture's pictures] Yeah. You just find all the stores over here.
Cartman: It's like, dude, sometimes it's good to buy stuff at all stores to get things in the stores that pay for your stuff. [shows his other pictures of the store] But this is the closest I've ever come. The stores right behind where I just left off.
Kyle: Yeah, and where I came from?
Bebe: Yes, Kyle. [points to the picture to her left, and it has a logo with a giant bear on it] Okay, all right, let's look at the rest of the mall. [points to the boys taking snapshots, and they smile]
Stan: Alright, what kind of shoes do they wear?
Stan: [quickly points to something to the right, and it has a picture of Cartman and the bear on it] Okay, and they're like, "Oh, hey, I found a shoe store in town."
Liane: Uh, okay, that's right, well, let's take off our shoes for our lesson.
Cartman: [the picture opens quickly] Hey! AAAAAHH!
Kids: [swoons over the logo] Ohhhhhhh! [leaves the picture]
Scene Description: Cartman walks in with Kyle.
Cartman: Alright, boys, let's start with The Good Buy, here in South Park. Here's your shopping cart ready to shop. [next, a box of shoes, some makeup, and some books are put in]
Cartman: I got shoes right here [closes the door. His smile fades] and here's some basics and jewelry. [next, Cartman stops and sees a new pair of shoes]
Stan: Hey Cartman, what is this thing?
Cartman: [jumps up and starts walking] Ohhh! [next, a pair of shoes] I found a brand new pair of shoes [quickly turns around and hops off]
Cartman: [the shoes are the most popular items - they come in the color of your choice - black, red, and yellow. Now just keep looking at the rest of the store, okay? [next, a pair of shoes, some makeup, and some books all in their own nicest colors] I'm gonna buy shoes at all of you for my birthday party.
Cartman:...Okay, and there's these nice, clean shoes?
Stan: Who's the real man now?
Cartman: Oh yeah, here's a nice shoe, please! [next, another pair of shoes] I'm gonna buy some more shoes for my anniversary party. [next, a pair of shoes] I love shoes! [next, a pair of shoes] What's they call?
Scene Description: Cartman walks up and takes a seat next to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
Cartman: Okay guys, let's start with Butters' [looks around just in time to see the shoppers go by] Ohhh-oh! [Cartman notices some shoppers, and the others take notice. The others follow suit. Cartman looks around] Alright, here he is, Butters! I just got some new shoes here! [Cartman is wearing a black T-shirt, and he carries the shoes in his hands at the same time as Stan is walking around. The other shoppers follow suit. When he gets the shoes to take off, he gets to work]
Butters: [quickly glances at Cartman] Hey cool, yeah.
Blond: Ohh, okay! Uh what's the deal? [The shoppers disperse. Butters notices his shoes and walks over to the front doors]
Cartman: [looks up] Dude. Hey nice shoes. Uh they're all new for the day!
Blond: [moves down from his booth] Hey hey I don't like these! Now I can order these to go upstairs! [turns to face the shoppers]
Townsman: Okay.
Butters: Hey hey uh, hello, Eric. [moves by...] Hey! Hi Eric. [quickly approaches] Hey, hey Eric.
Cartman: Ahhh. Ohhhhh, hello, all right?
Kyle: Hey, Cartman, what are you doing?
Cartman: You didn't see Eric Cartman at the school?
Kyle: Butters, you see? Did he even know?
Cartman: Well, I don't think so. Hehehehess a man now?
Townsman: Okay, that's cool. [Cartman turns around and walks towards the main line] Ohhh!
Cartman: Yeah. Hey hey. Uh huh. Well if you got these, I'm gonna ask him for one of mine. Okay.
Cartman: Alright, [hops off his booth and walks up to his car, and the sound of sirens fills the air] I don't know what I'm gonna do.
A man: Oh, hello? Hey uh, ohhhh.
Cartman: But you need some money, huh?
Townsman 3: Yeah!
Kyle: How do you like these?
Cartman: Well, no worries.
Scene Description: A couple of windows, but... all the lights are out. And then some shoppers enter.
A man: Hey hey, wait, let's go get some clothes. This place was great.
Townsman 3: No problem.
Blond: [grabs his jacket off] Okay, cool. Cool. [turns around]
Townsman 4: [to the man] Okay, cool.
Cartman: Oh, I get it.'s a lot of new shoes, yeah.
Scene Description: Outside the couple's room, later. In the living room, Butters is talking with Cartman.
Cartman: Aw, I-I guess that makes sense, Butters. [turns around] What, Butters? I-I... I know you have an itch.
Butters: I have an itch, you guys. Um... I've been itching to see if-
Cartman: You ever have an itch?
Butters: You never have an itch?
Cartman: I guess, just- I can say that-hmm, maybe I did when you were in school. [turns around] Or somethin' like, [turns around] you had that itch too, and then went to my teacher's office and she said she had to come with you to see if this was a problem, so she said all the other teachers had herpes, and uh, I-I've been thinking, "Aw, why did her have to come back to see if this is a problem?"
Butters: I can't tell you, Butters.
Cartman: Butters... I didn't. That's not fair. She's pretty good with getting what she wants, isn't she?
Butters: Hey, I can't tell you, I can't tell you, [turns around]
Cartman: [looks back at Butters] Butters, do you know what it is?
Butters: The herpes problem? [the others look at him for a few seconds]
Cartman: No, it's a little hard, Butters. It's a little nerve-wracking for me, really. I hate to have herpes.
Butters: But that's okay, okay?!
Cartman: [looks back at Butters] Butters, if this is some kind of joke, maybe we should go do something about it.
Butters: [stands up] No no no, you're sorry Butters. I-I have herpes! [to Butters] Why, Butters, ah I only got herpes now.
Butters: Well, I have to be really careful because I don't know what all these herpes people are capable of.
Cartman: All right, well, Butters, I understand. I'm sorry, but uh here's your excuse. My name's Butters. I thought you... got herpes.
Butters: [walks up] Well you're what??
Cartman: Uh well, you know Butters?? I don-I'm not here to tell you, Butters. I wrote out all this stuff on my blog. If you wanna see some herpes you'd better go to your room and look in.
Butters: [happily] Yes? Oh hey, look, uh but I'm trying to explain it-
Cartman: Well let me explain, alright, ah ah I really think, let me explain the stuff inside one of a woman.
Butters: Look, I don't know if I'm being serious or serious, okay?!
Cartman: How do you know that?!
Butters: Because I've already read all the herpes studies! And I am still in school, alright?! Uh ah I mean, see? I'm gonna miss the Christmas show, but I can still get to the actual party.
Cartman: You know this isn't gonna work for you, Butters. Look... if you really wanna see a real herpes you might wanna go to The Church of the Fallen, just like Jimmy Buffett did or Craig Maxi did. And if you don't, then maybe this'll prove the point. [Butters lowers his voice and thinks about...] My parents gave me herpes some time back when I was 13. Let's see; [they look at him again, then walk away]
Scene Description: The bus stop, later. Cartman takes the kids through to the bus. At the bus stop, Butters is at his locker holding a clipboard
Butters: All right, guys. Let's listen to Cartman.
Scene Description: The bus stop, later. Eric drives home.
Cartman: Thanks, Kyle. Thank you. Happy holidays, guys!
Kyle: Wow, cool. Good luck getting through this, dude.
Cartman: [hops off of the bus] Come on, come on, Kyle. [Kyle backs up and goes in]
Kyle: Alright. We should get some other girls in.
Cartman: All right now, let's see what I have here.
Kyle: Aaahhhh, that's a... vagina?
Cartman: It's not a vagina at all. It's a hole in the ozone layer.
Kyle: So uhh, uhh, oh, it's just a... vagina?
Cartman: Oh
