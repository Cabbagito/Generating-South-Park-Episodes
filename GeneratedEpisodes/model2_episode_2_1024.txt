The Boys: Okay, Stan, now we have a minute. Stan, if you've ever walked down Main Street, you've seen the Wall-Mart?
Stan: Yeah.
The Boys: Aand have you seen the Wall-Mart? It's... it's so... big it sprouted its ass out of a hundred quarts, and now it's starting to serve as an amusement park for the underprivileged.
Cartman: Look you guys! This is the Wall-Mart! It has almost reached the top! [an assistant steps forward, grinning. The doors open behind the boys and three guards step back to the mall]
Kyle: Can we take a look?
Stan: Come on guys! Let's get inside! [leads them out]

Cartman: AAAAAAAA! AAAAAAA! Eeeeh! [stops, turns and runs, and the lights are out]
Kyle: What happened?
Stan: We found it! Somebody's breaking into the mall!
Kyle: [looks to his right and calls out] Jesus! You guys! [some shoppers stop what they're doing and look back]
Rick: [walks over to the boys] Hey, can I come down to the backside for a second, please?
Kyle: No, it's totally closed. But we know how hard it is to get inside if you guys wanna shop here.
Rick: You gotta get inside the mall, Kyle! [the boys walk off, and Rick gives the tour manager a tour of the store]
Cartman: The Wall-Mart is a great resource for people who need it most.
Kyle (whispers): [approaches] Hey guys! There's a new way out of the broken heart!
Rick: What's a "breaking heart?"
Cartman: Aww, he's not talking about a broken heart!
Kyle: But the Wall-Mart is our friend!
Cartman: No, we're all gonna find a way inside to get in.
Scene Description: Inside...
Kyle: It's right outside at the Wall-Mart!
Cartman: That'd be a Wall-Mart inside a millionth time! [stops, turns, and runs again, again]

Scene Description: Randy's headquarters, Monday morning. The townsfolk watch the town, not knowing if any of the Wall-Mart has built a wall to block anything from Wall-Mart, but it should. The Wall? Wall-Mart building has two beams: a center beam with beams coming from the outside wall and a side beam coming from the inside. Inside, Randy and the townsfolk shield their faces. Randy is wearing his own face-piece hat
Randy: They are out!
Townsfolk 1: Let's put an end to them!
Randy: We're not letting Wall-Mart destroy the town!
Townsfolk 2: Yeah! [they charge forward]
Randy: Let's make it as safe and beautiful as they can!
Scene Description: The crowd continues to push the Wall-Mart forward, but at a much higher level. A large building with a glass and a glass dome built to block off any other entrances. A sign now has a huge Wall-Man 1 that says "Wall-Mart", as in classic Wall-Mart heyday, built over the center stage. The sound of shattering glass is heard as kids and adults approach it and approach the building, its collapse continues.
Randy: It has been built; we must try!
Randy: I know! I am ready to do my job! [the crowd attacks the wall, but no one joins them. The wall blocks them in all directions and finally does so, stopping in its tracks. Wall-Mart stands tall and mighty]
Cartman: [intervenes] Hello?
Stuart: It's been built!
Randy: Wall-Mart is back! [the crowd begins splitting in two, and two steps forward]
Stan: We're all out, too. [the Wall-Mart does the same for Men 5 and 4]
Stuart: Look out! It's coming! It's coming! [the crowd begins moving faster and faster]
Cartman: What are you talking about, Marsh?
Townsfolk: It's coming! [Randy sees the crowd charging up and attacking the wall] It has broken!
Barkley: [stopping the way] It is breaking! [the kids and adults fight back, but the adults succeed]
Clyde: This is hopeless! [the sound of shattering glass is heard]
Man 27: You can see it! It's coming!
Randy: Oh Jesus! [Randy is surprised] Yes it is! [walks up to the front one and begins to run to it, sweeping the floor under the kids and adults screaming]
Skeeter: What are you
