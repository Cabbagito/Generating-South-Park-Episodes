Scene Description: South Park Elementary Gym, day. The cheerleaders and their families are beating off the Cows at the Special Olympics stadium. Only Butters is on stage. The curtains open to reveal the mayor and her aides standing behind him.
Mayor McDaniels: All right, folks, cheers for the Special Olympics, which we believe should be the most awesome thing ever! And now back to PC Principal.
PC Principal: [walks up] Well, have a seat, everyone. [everyone sits] We had a big Special Olympic meeting, and apparently the person who made the cutest baby is just a freakin' douche. You need to hear that out. [more chatter from the kids]
Daughter: Oh, no way! [Cartman looks over at Kyle, but doesn't see what's happening]
Cartman: Did you hear that, Kyle? Your little girlfriend made another baby... dude.
Kyle: [taps Cartman twice on the shoulder] Aw man, I'm just really scared.
Cartman: Just 'cause she's a girl doesn't mean she's a bitch.
Mayor McDaniels: [appears at the podium] People, please, listen up. There's been a lot of hurt in the past few months and... everyone needs to be better. You can't just go around saying we're not a real sport anymore.
Strong Woman: [appears at the podium] Yes, we are, Mayor, Strong Woman. It has been many months since I've had my daughter hurt someone else. I wanna do everything I can to ease those feelings now.
Mayor McDaniels: We realize that everyone's feelings for a young girl can be hormonal. That's why we all need to have strong women. We've talked about it on various television shows, and we've found that women make up a very under-appreciated and very special sport. [Butters' hat is shown]
PC Principal: [now holding Butters' hand] And apparently that little girl also got her period, and while being a cop, she went out and got a dick in her mouth! Go on, tell me what's going on.
Strong Woman: You know what I think, Mayor, is that if you wanna go throw it in the gym, you need to get to the store and get your tampons out of there!
Butters: You want me to throw a fit?!
PC Principal: IF you ever did go out with her, you could all be out for several days, as long as she stays here with you every day.
Scene Description: The Special Olympics stadium. Strong Woman walks through the crowd, first getting her period, then gets in a squad, then gets on stage. She steps aside to begin taking pictures while Mayor McDaniels takes pictures.

[a view of the audience members.] Some of them get ready. Among them are Muhammad, Barbra Streisand, Esther Fuentes and Numan, Millie, and Nurse Gollum, then the disabled community volunteers, then the handicapped kids, then the kids on the field, then gets a picture of Butters. And then two men on the bull, then gets a picture of Heather Swanson as the swimsuit model, then the two women from around the bleachers, then gets to be in a video then.
Strong Woman: Hey, what's going on?! It's my honor to put a stop to all this! And I finally broke a man's mind of myself! Now get back to the Games!
Scene Description: The stands being used as a store, so how about a question mark. [points to Heather Swanson is still there. A boy goes on stage, then gets an open mic
Mike: Okay, and now as well. The hope is that this will be... honored for Heidi Turner, Heather Swanson.
Heather: Aww, thank you! [turns away.] Can I get it?!
Mayor McDaniels: Yes! [stands up and shows her aides. Strong Woman places her left hand on a boy. A different boy, Heidi.
Heather: All right, Turner, we are here to congratulate you for beating off the boys at the Olympics. Yes, for beating the other handicapped kid, you are now the world champions! I tell you!

Man with foot on head: Well what the heck are you, a "cheater"? We're professional athletes too!
PC Principal: We don't even wanna be called " athletes! We don't believe in bashing other people's heads! How could you be the Olympics champions! How could you be the Special Olympics medalists?! How could you?!"
Man with no heartless double-ended-butthrows? We're athletes! Why don't give away your medal, no?!
Strong Woman, woman!
PC Principal: Because you know we don't deserve it!
Strong Woman!
Strong Woman: [punches him out! [punches him out; he throws him away] I'm sorry, and I'm sorry! I'll take that medal! I won't rise! [a wallows in the stands down]

Heather: With... the help from... Heidi Swanson. [the crowd cheers. Heidi turns around.]
Mayor McDaniels: [begins to pucker up] Heidi! [stands up and goes after the boy. A few audience members look back] All right, here we go.
Heather: The Games aren't about you, Mayor! They're about me! [turns and faces Heather] The Games are for YOU! [turns back to the mic.]
