Randy: [pinches him] You've got to admit you have a problem, didn't you, Kyle?!
Kyle: Look, Dad, I, I don't know-I'm... totally not gonna tell anybody! Look, see? I'm totally not gonna have an affair with somebody who doesn't have an affair with either of them.
Randy: You know what I'm talking about, Kyle? We have to admit that we might be having an affair because we're having a relationship! Because that's how people get married!
Kyle: You're so full of crap! You can't even keep an affair!
Stan: [firmly] It's hard for me. All we have to do is admit that... we might be having an affair someday.
Sharon: [pinches him] You're right. [rips him off her left arm] You're so full of crap.
