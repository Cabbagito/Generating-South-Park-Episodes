... [begins removing the lid.] Look! [a small glowing sphere appears before him]
Fern Boy: Eeyy!
Fern Boy: Heeyy! [the sphere begins to glow] Eeey! Ey!
Kids: Eeyy! [Kyle rushes over to see what the fern boy is doin']
Kyle: What the? Get up there, fellas! [sees a red truck and jumps down]
Fern Boy: [now clearing his fields] Holy crap! Oh, boy! I'm glad to see you guys! You gotta see that assholes! [finally locates Kyle] And that cockroach! [looks around] What's that? That weird cockroach!
Kyle: Stop what you're doin' with it!
Fern Boy: [at first] What?
Kyle: Hehey yeah! [the other kids and his friends rush in with him and lock themselves in their seats in the fern cell] Hey! Kyle, you're okay!
Kenny: (What?!) [he and Kenny look up with a mischievous expression]
Kyle: I'm okay!
Fern Boy: [panicked] Heeyy! [begins to make fists] Heeyyyy! [stops] No, you can't go in there!
Kyle: [wipes away his tears and holds out his arms, palms out, and eyes closed] I'm not cool, heeyy! You all think I'm cool, but where are you gonna find me? [the kid and friends leave their seats] I'm going down to Eartharium with a cool new power! Thanks, Kyle. I'll see you later. [Cartman enters with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]
Cartman: Uh, sorry, but we got a few visitors.
Kyle: Oh...
Cartman: [scared, shakes his head vigorously] Oh, God-damnit! You guys. Okay, you go. Okay, tell me why you left Eartharium, Cartman! Why you gave the place over to some assholes who wanted to find chicks!
Cartman: You do?
Stan: Oh, Jesus, yeah!
Cartman: Well, I really, I shouldn't be saying you were your friend.
Kyle: What??
Cartman: I'm not a friend of yours or you guys. Heck, I'm not, see? I'm not cool - Christ - I'm not cool.
Stan: Umm... we're trying to change the way people think, dude.
Stan: Me too, dude!
Cartman: Well, I'm not really sure how we should change the way people think, but... I totally think there are better things than straight people thinking that way.
Kyle: You'll never go anywhere!
Cartman: I'm not.
Kyle: No. We can't change the way people think, dude. That'll ruin all of us. I'll be Cartman.
Cartman: That'd be great if both of us could go back to Earth. If there's no one to replace you, we can just go to somewhere else.
Stan: No. Actually, I think we should change the way people think.
Cartman: That'll, of course.
Stan: We could try.
Cartman: We could change the way people think. Hey, maybe there are more people like you out there than just gingers!
Kyle: Yeah!
Cartman: Oh, I'm gonna try!
Kyle: Me too!
Cartman: Hey yeah! [looks around] You guys, come quick! I can't hear ya! Come on! [rushes out of the bar]
Kyle: Huh?
Cartman: [comes up behind Stan and hops offstage, running back] Sweet! [runs up to the bar] Uh, hello. Uh, uh, Mr. Foley, uh, could you do uh... hmm, wowwwuh... hello everyone, umm, howww, mmm, howww, mmm goshuh, mmm, I heard that the gay groups are tryin' to de... uh, stop it?
Stan: What?
Cartman: [stops and listens] You know, we've all just heard that the uh, fuh, the gingers are trying to put us in jeopardy because people don't wanna be safe.
Kyle: What?? That's ridiculous!
Cartman: I-I-yeah it's ridiculous, but uh, we believe that w-well, at some point we need to realize that just because somebody who's ginger doesn't mean the entire town is givin'him everything!
Darryl Weathers: There's no way the gays are givin'him everything while they try to put us in jeopardy by queefing.
Cartman: Well at some point we'll realize there are gay people here trying to ruin everything, just because we queefed.
