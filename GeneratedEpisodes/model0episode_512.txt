Kyle: All right Mom and Dad, what's gonna happen if we kill your son?
Gerry:...Ohhhh-huh... Okay. If we try to kill him, we can't do it, Dad. But I promise that he'll get better.
Kyle: It is impossible. We can't kill him. Dad has been very strong and has been through all that. But we didn't kill him.
Gerry: Aw no, that does not mean Dad has to suffer. He's not allowed to die on his own, no matter what the cost.
Kyle: We can! But if we kill him at the same time, we kill him!
Gerry: [dramatic music appears] What? What the hell are you doin' with him, kid? We do it right here.
Scene Description: Stan's house, lunchtime. He's still walking around the living room talking
Stan: Well, I'm sorry, I was just talking about things being okay sometimes. It's pretty cool to know that you have a child now. I guess maybe, just maybe, being with a child is a little... little better than being alone. [the doorbell rings, and some of the kids begin to enter through the front door, and the three other boys go in]
Cartman: Heh yes, it's Craig and Sheila!
Stan: Dude, he said everything was okay in Stan's room?
Stan: Yeah, all right. [the boys pass by and stop to think about it, with one look on face]
Kyle: Dude, what the hell?
Stan:...He said everything was okay in the Stan's room.
Stan: Well, he said everything was okay. [a close up reveals everything in the living room]
Scene Description: Kyle's room. His Dad's in his bathrobe, Gerald on the floor watching TV with his iPhone in his hand, Kyle listening to news on his phone
Dad: [gives a thumbs up] Oh yeah, I believe it's going to be okay. [Kyle glances towards Gerald]
Kyle: I bet there's someone... we can call. [looks at his phone] Yeah? [begins to dial] [Gerald's jaw drops a bit] Alright, dude. Can I get some more from my friend Kyle if he seems to have a problem? [Kyle clicks on the TV]
Scene Description: South Park, day. The camera pans over the park as three large men approach the park.
Woman 1: I think it's Scott. He's in here. You want a picture of your son? [a man steps out from behind the group and approaches him.]
Scott: What are you doing here?
Woman 2: He's in here. You want one copy of his mother's picture? [Scott walks over and starts talking to the man]
Scott: You, how come you don't know who she is? [takes a picture of Kyle and walks away]
Woman 3: [sits behind Craig and Sheila] Yeah, we all see everything on his phone and think he's our son, but you know it's not, you know, his mom...
Scott: [moves to get a better look than the man] You don't think Kyle's mom works here, do you? He's totally a dick.
Woman 3: [takes a picture of Kyle and reaches up over his shoulder] You're the one who saw his mom's baby when he was younger.
Scott: You want some pictures? [the man just looks at her, then turns around with his eyes to avoid them. The couple looks at each other, then both turn around, the woman on the ground, and the man in his head.]
Woman 3: Hey Scott.
Scott: [rushes up to Craig and Sheila to join them in the study] What is it, Scott? Can I help you tonight?
Woman 3: [softly] "Scott, I want a picture of you looking like a dick." That's what he said.
Scott: You say? But I don't want it right now. [somewhat excited, Sheila and Craig look down into the study] What is my picture of you doing here?!
Woman 3: [looks up into the sky in an even more dramatic way] "Wow, it's such a badass picture of you looking like a dick."
Scott: I just don't want your picture.
Woman 3: I feel really bad for him right now, Scott. We're really close.
Craig: [talks to Sheila] "Shy. [The camera pans down and Kyle's view of Scott is shown.]
Woman 3: [voice only] You can't just shut up about anything. I-you have to work! [leaves]
Scott: [sees the man and moves aside, then rushes to the sink, then returns] You see?! Look. You got the picture of the guy. [sits on the floor against the wall, hands him one. Three women follow him in, but they stop as he moves along. He slowly lowers his glasses to reveal a pair of briefs under his briefs] I've got a black bra, white shirt, a small brown hat and lots of green shoes [walks away] [approaches a desk, picks up a coat, and sits against it, hands it the coat, then writes a letter on it] This is the way you look. [the camera goes in another direction, with Kyle, Craig, and the woman in the picture looking at him from a distance.] Get ahold of my ass. [he quickly slips off. The man stays on Kyle's chair and writes, "Hello Scott."] And then I get a brown jacket, a tie, and some kind of green hat [clyde and the woman's face appear in the background]. Oh, Scott. So how do we make you feel?
Scott: That's how I feel. I'm not a woman anymore.
Woman 3: You feel really bad for your partner?
Scott: Well, because, I know it's difficult. I just need to get to the bottom of everything. [goes into a deep voice full of anxiety] I don't know if I ever really get to know or make fun of...
Woman 4: That sounds really fucked up.
Woman 5: [sobbing] Scott, you are so depressed!
Scott: I'm supposed to be in this relationship! [a man is seen seated at the computer, crying, with a small boy on the wall nearby nearby] And I can't see a man in his face! I just cannot. [the man looks around angrily and walks over. Two men come close behind him]
Scene Description: Kyle's room, moments later. Kyle is on his bed. In the next room, Butters is at the computer. He is working on a new song.
Butters: [he's reading one] Oh, that's cool. You guys are all kind of cool, Butters. I really think I can relate to you guys.
Craig: That's right. I just do not like you guys getting laid.
Butters: Well... [they're gone] Well, well. [they look at each other]
Craig: Well you guys, what the hell have you done?!
Butters: Well, I'm just... not very interested in you guys because it's a... strange friendship.
Craig: Well, Butters... I know. How do you feel, Butters?
Butters: Well, what can I just do to help make you happy?
Craig: You mean, like... come on, it could be better?
Butters: I don't wanna... make friends with you guys! Come on, let's go! [points his fingers at his temple]
Craig: Okay, but you don't have any friends.
Butters: Well, you haven't been very important to me, Craig. You have-
Craig: But what? [they approach him] Butters, what are you doing?!
Butters: Well, I was thinking: Wait a minute. If I was on your team, then all that I have for friendship right now would be a-
Craig: Well, you don't think I'm cool? Just look at this. It's like when you guys start to talk like nothing happened, I'll realize that I really do care about this friendship you guys are building. [coughs up a small stream of piss]
Scene Description: The living room, moments later. The boys stand back and wait to be called on. Craig is typing away.
Craig: You know, if you're like me, all the time you make friendship a little more fragile, because you end up... in a relationship that's sort of like... a fluke.
Butters: It's just not what I meant. It's not what I meant.
Clyde: Maybe Butters is right.
Craig: It would be stupid to try and make a friendship with Craig.
Clyde: You know, Craig, you might wanna make up all of your stuff, like, a relationship that really doesn't work as long as you stay around, and you just keep looking for... friends. [coughs up some piss, drops his pen, and leaves]
Craig: But I just... made it a little better once I realized, um... that this is the best friendship you've ever had.
Cartman: I'm sorry, Butters, so you have to stop pretending forever and focus on your friends.
Clyde: [stabs his hand away quickly and whispers] I was just... making it a little more fragile if I don't know,
Craig: Butters! [Clyde crosses his arms] I think you need to listen to me, okay? Butters, I'm talking to you right now. [he walks out of view again] I promise you. [walks away] You have to calm down.
Scene Description: South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Two boys stand by. Stan, Kyle and Cartman take notes on the girls' behavior. The boys watch as Wendy walks down the hall, and Cartman takes notes on the girls' behavior. Wendy glances at Craig as Wendy looks at Cartman, then at Towelie and Kyle, then at Towelie and Kyle, then at Wendy, then at Heidi and Kim. Craig looks at her, then at Stan, then at Cartman, and finally at Wendy, looking at himself.
Stan: Butters! What have you done to me?!
Butters: Nobody cares about me! [turns away and turns to face the class] We have all the best friendships in the world! [sneaks over to catch Randy] Randy Marsh, what's wrong with you?
Randy: I don't know. Not anymore. Hey, look, if people keep hearing that Wendy has to
