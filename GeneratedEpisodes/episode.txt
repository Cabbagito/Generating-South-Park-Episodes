Scene Description: At almost 3 A.M., the Marshes stand at the edge of a cliff looking back at the sun rowing in the stars.
Sharon: I don't know what's going on but... I think now there's been a conscious decision to not look up into the sky. [a view of the Earth from space appears] It seems that everyone is looking somewhere else. [a view of Earth from space appears] A lot of the planet is changing over time, looking down, as if its entire universe revolves around the sun. And now... [another view of Earth appears] There's... a giant reptilian bird, looking at us from space. [this gives scientists pause] I think this is the Carl Dipshit Show, in all its glory.
Dr. Mephesto: You're just trying to get people to go to space, aren't you?
Sharon: Carl! We all want to see our planet, aren't we? Now take a look!
Dr. Mephesto: Look up to the sky! And then down! [a view of Earth appears] There's over a hundred alien ships right at our planet! We can't wait!
Scene Description: At exactly the same time, during the episode, there are over a hundred men on two planetariums shooting their bodies into space.
Dr. Adams: We've done it! You've made our species immortal! [the planetarium is shown again] Your species is going to live!
Scene Description: In the planetarium's star system, Dr. Adams leads the class down a futuristic hallway, visiting each of the seven stars.
Dr. Adams: I want you all to feel welcome, because this is the planetarium. [four stars appear in the hallway] Every planet has an open door [in one case, a room]. Everyone is just sitting here, waiting. [in the other case, Cartman appears, cramped in a chair behind him] We will now go over the basics of rocket science, and then we will be getting to the rocket.
Cartman: [retorts] Oh, dude, ha ha ha, ha ha ha! [walks over to Kyle and points] You were totally right, Kyle! There's a god-awful, foul, planetarium behind us! I'll bet you all have gone to the space center!
Butters: [in the same room, having seen Cartman, is now bored.] Ah, I just like this place.
Cartman: Shut up, Butters!
Dr. Adams: All right, make asses of it.
Scene Description: In the planetarium, Cartman strapped onto a small yellow star and is now surrounded by a thick glass wall.
Cartman: Go, go, go, go.
Doctor Adams: [approaches Cartman] I'm sorry, Eric, but the young man out there wants to join our class. It is his hope that you can make the right changes.
Cartman: [his wheelchair falls off and falls out of the glass wall to the ground. He gets up in his seat] Change? Change?
Doctor Adams: I am very excited to show you the wonders of the universe. [reaches for a star and points to it. Cartman looks] There you can see the constellation called, Orion. [points to the constellation and is instantly alarmed when an obese man walks by]
Obese man: Awww!
Cartman: You see boys, I'm pretty much an out of body!
Doctor Adams: But do you think you could make it, young man? [Cartman looks back at the camera] The obese man is just a block of skin over there. [points to the obese man again, and Cartman gasps in recognition] Now you see, the obese man is an out of body, filling a hole in the wall.
Cartman: [quickly points to the line] Hey, that's the line!
Doctor Adams: The obese male is one of the leading causes of obesity. His weight was originally [points to the large solid penis], lost in an accident or an accident, and he is now over this very line. [Cartman has a pretty big nose, indicating he has major heart disease] Your young friend has the features of a broken heart. And like his father, his mom has a massive nose, and big balls.
Cartman: D'ooooh. [smiles]
Stan: [enters from the other side of the line] Hey dudes. How's the rest going?
Cartman: Good.
Stan: Cartman?
Kyle: Dude, that's Cartman.
Cartman: [relaxing] "Good"?? Old people always say "good," like you always say, "that's the way it is." Well, I gotta go home. Ah, I'll be there in a minute. E- Hello?
Ms. Crabtree: [from the entrance, yelling at someone to be in line] Is this the Broflovski residence?
Stan: Uh yeah, we're here with our friend, Kenny.
Kyle: Oh, dude, we're here with him.
Cartman: His parents are Romanian.
Ms. Crabtree: OH, my God!
Kenny: (Eheh!)
Kyle: [looks at Cartman] Whoa, dude.
Cartman: Eheh, hey everybody. You're a big fat dick, so where did you get that in your nose?
Stan: Aaah, hah. Ah, I think Kenny's parents might know something. [Kenny waves his hand over her shoulder]
Cartman: Yeah. [opens his right nostril, which was sealed by a small bottle] Apparently Kenny's family don't live in Romania. What is that?
Kenny: (Uh huh.)
Kyle: You don't think it's stupid, Cartman. As long as your parents don't know about it, they'll just assume that you've got a big nose, and a bulge, and that's why they come here.
Cartman: Yeah. Now listen. Parents in America don't know what they're talking about! In Romania they don't say anything like that! Unless, of course, your middle-class white-haired parents get their noses drilled here.
Kyle: Hey. Hey, that's not cool.
Stan: Yeah, it does.
Scene Description: Romanian School of Health, day.
Nurse: [sees a fit to go in and walks over] O, Ms. Crabtree, are you going to the office?
Ms. Crabtree: Oh, ooh, yes ma'am. Thank you.
Nurse: [quite embarrassed] Can I help you? [she begins to walk to the door]
Ms. Crabtree: [emotional] Mommy! Momm-melly! Do you like tinkle-tucky? [her phone rings and she answers it] Hello?
Boy 1: [in the office] Hello?
Boy 2: This is Bill. He's a little kid that just wanted to work. Can he be our friend?
Nurse: Oh. Well, let's suppose that.
Boy 3: Well, we can work this thing out.
Nurse: Bill, someone sent you an Fudgecicle, a Pillsbury Doughnut, and a Snacky S'more Thwizler. [no response] No?
Boy 1: It's okay.
Nurse: It's not okay to just make fun of an already-established fact.
Boy 3: Well, let's put it out on the table. [the nurse brings the dish to the table. Bill just cradles it, smiling. The tray doesn't have the marijuana content of the original four tray]
Nurse: O, sorry, kid. [looks at Bill over his shoulder, then glares at him] Did you get that?! Kids just filled their heads with lies and made-up stories about how perfectly young you are! Well don't worry! It's over, Bill. Romania is making a comeback! Things are finally gonna be different around here in America. [the nurse leads him out] You won't believe the things America has done to you lately. [he leaves and reaches the exit, where Bill just looks at him] With everything going for Nut Gobbler. It's all thanks to Nut Gobbler. [looks back to his friends]
Scene Description: John Elway Memorial Park. Inside the Memorial Park, the four boys run up to a long table with two stools at one end.
Kyle: Dude, we can't wait to see the post office! We can give our parents herpes!
Stan: Well, what do we do?
Cartman: Just face it: somebody will have to run in and get our moms herpes, at the post office.
General Tso: No, that's impossible!
Kyle: How can somebody get herpes?
General Tso: Someone who has had us bit. We have to get someone with a little illness to get it now, before anybody else sees this.
Kyle: Really?
Stan: Yeah, dude. It's a long shot. You have to get somebody infected with herpes from an infected poo right in front of your mom.
General Tso: Oh, you mean like... with a fever?
Stan: Yeah. That's herpes.
Cartman: Ya hear that Kyle?
Kyle: Yeah. Hildograzy.
Scene Description: A camera pans away from the boys to a close-up of Kyle getting herpes. Two people take shots at each other, starting with Kenny. They stop by a woman, who gets herpes
Woman 1: Ohmigod!
Woman 2: Ohmigod!
Kyle: Sick, dude!
General Tso: Just get your things, boys. [Tosse goes to get the gum and the boys return to the table.]
Kyle: Okay, I need those. [tosse some more gum into a bowl]
Stan: Look, we only have free gum now; there doesn't really need any cash.
Kyle: Y-you don't?
Stan: Look, I know I can't give you free gum. It's just my idea.
Kyle: But uh, eh, I, I'm sure this whole thing has been a disaster.
General Tso: You just have one last shot here, Kyle. If your mom isn't on the phone for you, just dial her and tell her I'm on the phone.
Kyle: [looks at General Tso for a few seconds]...T-tell her I'm on the phone?
Scene Description: The doctor's office, day. Sharon is there typing away at her laptop computer. Randy walks in and approaches her
Randy: Sharon, have you checked my blood?
Sharon: No, uh,
