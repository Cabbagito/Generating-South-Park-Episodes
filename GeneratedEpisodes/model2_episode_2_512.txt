Kenny: (Yeah. I mean, dude!) [Cartman just shrugs]
Cartman: You alright, Kenny?
Kenny: (No. Not okay! I'm gonna go home and play hide and go make my own Goddamned album!)
Cartman: [gets up and walks away] See you guys! [stops and turns...]
Scene Description: The Marsh house. Sharon stands outside the front door with Sharon and another family.
Sharon: This whole fucking mess is ridiculous, Stanley! We can't believe it!
Sharon: Well, it should have never happened!
Stan: Look at Kenny, I mean, his mom's really mad at him for doing what he's doing. She thinks he's a great artist.
Sharon: Let's just say he's mentally abusive as hell.
Stan: [turns and walks off] Yeah, but... he's not mentally abusive as hell!
Sharon: [turns to face Stan] And do you think he was?
Stan: She really thinks he's mentally abusive.
Sharon: Well, that's a pretty hard pill to swallow.
Sharon: Well, let's try to swallow it. [a tube of LARCAMBERRYXO compound is inserted into the chest]
Stan: We just do stupid things sometimes, Dad! We all have an idea how to deal with it!
Scene Description: The Marsh house. Randy's music swells as he sings to his friends: "My Country 'Tis Of Thee"
Sharon: Look, boys, this whole thing has gone so far without a telling. The whole time we've been keeping Kenny away from us.
Scene Description: Kenny's room. Cartman and Butters walk out.
Cartman: We thought you were dead, Kenny. Everyone knew.
Kenny: (No, I'm fine.)
Butters: [looking fatigued, with red hair] AAAAAAAHH!!! You're OK!!!
Stan: We're not dead!
Cartman: There! It's finally gonna be taken care of! [some scratching is heard, then the sound of an avalanche]
Stan: It's coming in! [walks closer and looks through the open door, and it reaches down and knocks. The door opens and Cartman comes out] Kenny, could I use your telephone?
Kenny: (No, of course)
Cartman: Oh, my God, I really should-
Kenny: (Okay.)
Cartman: [enters and goes into the living room] Come on, Kenny, you have to help, 'cause I want you dead. Just keep your hand out of it, you silly asshole.
Kenny: (I'm sorry!)
Cartman: I... I can't handle all that stuff anymore. I... I only... I can handle a few hours each day, all because... you were such an important part of my life. [the dust has settled down on him. He picks up the phone]
Kenny: (I'm sorry!)
Cartman: Come on, Kenny, help me find out how to get Mackey's kidney back.
Kenny: (Heh, that's better.) [talks into him a few times with Kenny on the other end]
Cartman: Kenny, help me find my son, 'cause I want you dead.
Kenny: (I'm sorry!)
Cartman: Come on, help me find my son, 'cause... I... want you dead.
Kenny: (I'm sorry!)
Cartman: Kenny.
Stan: Kenny?
Kenny: (I'm sorry!)
Kyle: What happens if we bring Mackey's organs back to your family?
Kenny: (I'm sorry!)
Cartman: Come on, Kenny! Kenny has to help me find this son!
Scene Description: Live-action segment, from the plane's perspective
Narrator: It now appears that Stan's son, Kenny McCormick, has taken his kidney from Stan's family. [The crew begins to leave their seats] It is now unknown if Kenny will be able to go on with his life as a father. [Kenny looks up to see the dead Kenny - Wendy]
Kenny: (All non-sabatarian bloodsucker bloodsucker!)
Scene Description: Stan's house, day. He picks up the phone and dials 9-1-1-1
Stan: Dude. Kenny has told me he's going to have a kidney transplant.
Carol: Yes, please.
Stan: Dude, are you serious?
Carol: Yes. I mean, you've just been trying to tell me this Kenny has a kidney... transplant is going to happen.
Stan: The kidney can't get enough of itself. We need to get it out of Kenny's system.
Scene Description: The Marsh house, day. Randy comes out to see the other parents for the funeral. Sharon approaches the coffin
Sharon: Randy, where the hell are you going?
Randy: You're going to Nebraska where I-
Sharon: I won't let you kill yourself, Randy!
Randy: You can't.
Sharon: No, you can't.
Randy: You can't kill yourself, Sharon! I don't believe you!
Sharon: I'll go home to watch cartoons, Dad. [Randy gets to the phone and dials]
Randy: [gets his signal.] Yes?
Sharon: Oh yes. The new kid wants to come visit.
Randy: Oh, sorry, sorry. [Sharon leaves]
Stan: Dude, we're sorry. But there's nothing we can do about this.
Scene Description: Randy's front door, day. Stan and Kyle walk in
Kyle: Dude, what's going on?
Stan: Dude, check the news. Kenny has been taken to Nebraska for a kidney transplant.
Kyle: I think we're gonna see him again tomorrow or something.
Stan: [sensing the irony] Maybe we can hold it in forever here.
Kyle: Well, hey Stan. Could I go with you to Nebraska tomorrow?
Stan: [off camera] No I won't!
Kyle: Yeah, I see you, Stan. Here's some chicken I made for your lunch today and... it's... good.
Stan: Yeah, right.
Kyle: Well I'll see you later, Stan. [Stan leaves]
Scene Description: A pasture near Pioneer Village and the tour is winding down. A horse stands in the distance waiting to leave. Once the tour is over, Stan approaches it and begins to dance
Stan: Hi there, Billy.
Billy: [walks up] Hi Stan. [to the other kids] Stan, what's the matter? [no one responds.]
Stan: Billy, this has changed all of a sudden. I know it's hard for me to believe that when you got Kenny's organs back this way, you really did things to his best.
Billy: Yeah, well, well, it happened too soon for Billy to suddenly forget what's happened to him.
Stan: Yeah, well, that's how things are always before.
Billy: Billy.
Stan: Billy, what's the matter?
Billy: Billy, I... [closes his eyes tight] I... this thing... happened.
Stan: Not yet, Billy. But Billy... [blinks him off]
Billy: Billy, have I touched you on a level?
Stan: Billy, this isn't the time. The tour is over. You cannot move to Nebraska again until we learn to live together, spiritually. Stan,... [blinks him off]
Billy: But when I do that, do you ever... feel like I'm gonna put you in a rocket? [looks down at the floor]
Stan: No! I... don't feel like rocket! This place has no buildings. I'm getting bored! [walks off]
Billy: You can't imagine being in all the excitement and all the singing and the performing. And then all the fun.
Stan: Oh shit! [walks out the door]
Kyle: Oh fuck! I hate it!
Pioneer Paul: [off camera] Yes, yes, and please, no smoking during the ride. [Stan leaves the tent and walks up to Pioneer Paul] All right! Let all the Pioneer Village workers know that you are absolutely 100% in favor of the tour. [Stan leaves and leaves, then returns with Pioneer Paul and turns around] Good luck, people!
Pioneer Paul: I know you're angry with us for what we're doing, but we want you to be happy!
Stan: [turns around] Look, I won't stop until we have everything we need to help those damned Native American people. [turns away and walks off, then returns to the tent]
Scene Description: Pioneer Village, outside. Music is heard as the men wait for the tour.
Singer: We are tired. We have to do something. Now [shows the tour group] we can go to work, work all we want. But we have to live one life. We can't just go to school anymore. At Bennigan's we have to stay in shape.
Worker 1: Look, this is all about finishing our bikes, alright? [looks at the tour group]
Singer: [shows the group] We love learning. That's what this place is all about. [points to the tour tour group] And getting to know the outdoors while still doing it right.
Worker 2: It's about all [the group looks at each other]
Passenger: That's what we all got, [the group looks at their bikes] because of us.
Worker 3: Yeah.
Passenger: And we are the ones who got work!
Woman 1: Hey, I love the outdoors.
Woman 2: I love the outdoors, too. You wanna try it? [the group hops on and is about to enter Pioneer Village. One of the men looks back as he sees how Randy got himself in costume, then stops and waves] It's so magical to us. Pioneer Village is like the magical land of the buffalo and ducks. [the group crosses its path at a fast clip] We can run across it and ride it without being soiled or harassed. [the group passes an opulent store with a lot of Native American clothes on it and the founder's wife appears dressed as deer] All you do is collect stuff, [the worker finishes his brief and returns to work] And then I'll drive you around to the forest and collect food from you.
Worker 2: Well that was fun. But now let's do what we do before the people get here. [the group passes a wooden sign asking for a tour guide under
