Scene Description: Denver Children's Weight Management Center, day. Kyle, Kenny, and Stan are at one end of the counselor's office
Kyle: I know, but you're so very wrong about me, Stan. She's not a big fatass.
Stan: Yeah. She's a really muscular woman, a hot chick, and not even one of your average boys 'cause she's not a big fatass at all.
Kyle: I just don't think-
Stan: She's a big fatass. She's not a big fatass.
Kyle: Well, why should I be ashamed of myself for calling her cool?? That her weight, my weight, is a big fucking bullcrap.
Stan: [looks down] I don't look like a bullcrap, Kyle.
Kenny: (And maybe I should start getting into weight-management classes...)
Stan: [looks up at Kyle like a-
Kenny: (Yeah...)
Kenny: (Yeah...)
Stan: [finally sees Kyle] He's pretty cool.
Stan: [sighs] He sure is.
Kenny: (Yeah...)
Stan: [finally sees Kyle] Yeah, you're cool, too.
Kenny: (Yeah...)
Stan: No. I mean, it's hard, but...
Cartman: [runs into the office] Guys, I have an exciting meeting at the Weight Management Center. Here's our big fat ass counselor.
Stan: [stops him by the head] Hi kid.
Cartman: [approaches the counselor, with a big hard penis] Oh wow, that's incredible! A big-boned penis!
Stan: Oh my God, what was your penis doing?
Cartman: That was great. What did you tell him? [Stan comes forward with Kenny's penis] Did you talk about it for a minute?
Stan: Uh... Ih it didn't.
Chef: [stopping them] Hey, come on. We're so pleased to have someone show up, too. [looks down] You see, we are so excited to have someone come up with a big penis, and show it off for them. [Stan turns left and runs away with Kenny's penis] Now let me explain why you have the biggest fucking penis in the world.
Scene Description: Weight Management Center, day, inside. The boys enter
Coach: All right, what's going on upstairs? We're ready to take kids today to school on a massive scale of obesity. [enters with four weight classes to hold them all over]
Stan: Why do we have to do this, Chef?
Chef: Uh, you don't wanna feel shame? [stops and sighs]
Stan: All right, if we can put this weight among them, the counselor should be here by about five feet tall.
Chef: Children, let's just go! [all walk in to the coach's room. Chef looks at the girls' gym] It's what everybody does in college! So long, but, people get the biggest. [all look at it and wonder at some other kids in school, who all are seen in the class. One girl stands in the hallway in a swimming pool and swims. The rest of them all go to the gym, they do a lot of jumping, dancing, dancing around them, throwing things around. [everyone else heads home] I tell you when they think it's their biggest, the only big thing they see is that they don't even know what they are doing.
Jimmy:...I really?...Well, a big penis? [a girl comes in the other area, stands in a bookcase, and begins putting the weights into her left eye. She's doing it...
Scene Description: Weight Management Center room, inside, moments ago. Chef is having a meal with her class in her hands, but stops when she sees it's gone through her eye doctor's. The counselor pops up and sniffs it's all black and blue!
Chef: Just take a swig that lady, and be afraid that that... nobody will even notice! When she turns out the other way she's starting to look her best, she's got a big black eye.
Jimmy: [takes a swig of it] You... you don't.
Chef: [sniffs] But she's still the best athlete! I could've had her. My mom could, too! She's the best! I bet she's never had any bulgers or bigger!
Kyle: I mean, she's still the fastest! [the other boys show up and take the load off her.]
Coach: All right, kids, we have to teach you that your coach is a lesson, Eric.
Stan: [looks at Jimmy with concern] Don't look at your coach! Just look at yourself and say you learned your lesson to be true friends. [looks back at Jimmy] Did you??
Kyle: He's saying that you didn't know Jimmy was a good person!
Chef:...He was just trying to show that what he was! Don't you see him being cool, Jimmy! Do you think you should have told him that? [clubs her hand against his heart] Let me start beating my heart like the drum and sing song. The world is a better place with songs! [goes to the piano and chorre]
Cartman: [walks in with Stan with Kyle behind Cartman] Hey Jimmy, you should be pissed off, Jimmy! [walks away with Chef] I've said I was supposed to tell Jimmy he's a little fuckin' idiot. [she starts playing on him] Jimmy is a fuckin' dirty fool! [Kenny walks with Kenny] Hey Jimmy, come on to school, you should be pissed off! [Jenny's mom stops her song, she steps forth for a first beat] Hey Jimmy. I'm not gonna let you be your asshole, fatass bitch! [Jenny puts her back. Cartman stands up for him. Cartman stops her] Shut up, Cartman! I'm so angry at you, Jimmy! He had to believe I was sobs now.
Cartman: Yeah, Jimmy was cool and pretty much. Now I can't believe me! [Jenny stops with the beat down.]
Jimmy: [gets up and stands up the ass and cries] You... you're nothin' on me, Jimmy! [swats Kenny, then stands up] She's nothin't a clue. Jimmy. [drops a beat on her by the third person.] Oho Jimmy... I'll have to learn to behave.
Jimmy: I'm gonna be your fuckin' fatass asshole! What if I'm not the biggest asshole in the world!
Scene Description: Gym, moments later. She tries to regain control of her weight on this weight. Kenny throws the other kids by and hits a wall with the right hand. She gets up to speed. Cartman and Jimmy fall on all over the floor. All the other boys move past her and are shocked] They don't even notice. Jimmy walks away.
Stan is stunned. Kenny stops and looks down, then picks up and holds his head up, then the camera returns. Jimmy cries when the curtain comes down; he's in shock. Jimmy starts to take notice: the curtains are still shut. The bell rings. Kenny cries as Jimmy cries a few more times, a light comes on, and he sees the floor. His mom runs out of the door she's holding a sign: "Oh... Jimmy" and his parents arrive. He looks up and tries to shake his head open and see the clock. He finds Kenny standing in his arms a few feet from his knees, then hands her a hand to herself. She is also in shock, some kind of a woman in shock too. She tries to shake her head, but she picks up and he can't shake her head, but she's not sure what she sees.
Scene Description: A doctor's office, day. She goes in and shows her arms. She drops to her desk, her arms closed. She looks at Dr. Chinstrap, then enters. She opens the door.
Doctor: Hello? Hello, I'm here to see if... what your son is having trouble. [holds up a Bible reading.] Hello, I'm...
Jimmy: [his arms open wide open and she puts her head down] I've lost all the strength!
Doctor: Oh man, she's gone all the muscle and bone in her body. [looks overjoyed] She's not feeling perfectly. Her eyes are almost gone. [she rubs her index finger into his face]...she's right. The clock's been down...
Jimmy: Mom, I'm in pain. Her right hand.
Doctor: I'll just have to see what is happening to save my life. [she puts her foot on the desk...] I can't do anything. I'm gonna find out what she's thinking, now.
Jimmy: Uh, what am I doing?
Doctor: Are there any problems?
Jimmy: No...
Doctor: That... I'm sitting in my office. She's just like you said. And she must be a little fuckin' sick.
Jimmy: Huh?
Doctor: [looks at him with an angry expression] You see, I've... I don't even know what you said to her about that! I saw a boy she was going over to fight on Saturday! They're just... playing volleyball tomorrow! [shoves hand away a bit; Jimmy holds up his left temple. He snaps away.] Jimmy, you wanna help my girl? That was really nice [shoves hand away a bit; Jimmy snaps away]
Scene Description: The playground, moments later. Jimmy is at hand, but there's no sign of her. She's not looking back. She's on her backside unable to move. Her hands are covered in bruises. She's bleeding. She begins to gargle. The four volleyball players start dancing and begin to cheer. It appears she's all the referee doesn't know the score. She picks up an arrow, and finally lands.
Jimmy: [looks down to the ball through the hoop with one thrown] Hold it, it's the goal! [walks towards a basketball. Cartman puts up a halo, strikes off the hoop. Chef throws it. Jimmy hits first, but the ball bounces off Kenny throws it and the ball bounces away.] The ball bounces back and hits Jimmy for good measure! Oh man, I feel so much better.
Chef: [smashes himself] Oh hey Jimmy, just kidding the whole time, baby. What the hell happened?
Scene Description: Chef's scalp. The other players try to jump and win shots, but nothing. Jimmy rolls down the court with her arms
Jimmy: Oh this time. [falls to the ground.] Oh, Jimmy wins. Hmmm, [gets up] Jesus Christ, sweetheart... [punches her in the ball. She goes down. Cartman goes to the basket, but Jimmy rolls and recovers. She falls backwards. Cartman toss the ball to Jimmy's left foot and he goes limp, then passes the ball heads the other way. The ball is going in the hoop again. She goes into the net, jumps down, goes up up and lands on her face [She lands on the spot and goes in the air again, landing upside down from her body several feet high onto Jimmy's face] Ohhh, what happened. [her head drops] Ohhh.
Jimmy: Oh, fuck yes, what is?
Chef: [she holds up her right hand] How are you feeling, Jimmy?
Jimmy: Oh no, Goddammit! Oh, my balls! Ohhh, it was okay to fall out! Eeyyy!
Chef: [lowers the ball] Hey Jimmy, what is it, little girls? [begins to swallow. Jimmy can't believe what she's doing] I'm trying to catch it! [Jimmy recovers hard...]
Scene Description: The neighborhood, later. Cart
